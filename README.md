# ABOUT
In addition to a github presentation, here is my organization and its purpose

# Project

Yes, we build our projects on GitHub, in fact we have been doing so since its inception, that's when we made our first commit.
Since then, we've pushed over 2.5 million commits, opened over a million issues, submitted around 650,000 pull requests in 4357 repositories from over 50 countries 🤯.
But that's just us, we're proud to be part of the work of millions of developers, companies and robots across the solar system

# 🍿 An interconnected community,
The open source community is the 💗 heart of GitHub and is fundamental to how we build software today, see for yourself:
GitHub Sponsors have helped support over 5,000 people and projects around the world 🌍
Open source projects on GitHub received 218 million contributions 🚀 in the last year alone
Every minute a developer creates a new version 🏄 for a public project on GitHub
Now that we're talking about the important stuff ☝️, do you contribute to open source? Yes? Okay, you rock!

# 🎸 Alternatively, we can help you get started,
Open source software is created by people like you. Learn more about how to contribute.

# 🦦 Contribute to the ecosystem,
We contribute to the tools 🔧 we rely on to build and run GitHub, while maintaining 🧙‍♂️ our own open source projects like:
GitHub CLI – A command line tool for GitHub
Git Large File Storage - A git extension for versioning large files
Introduction – The GitHub Design System

# 👓 Appendix,
Find out more on our public roadmap ✨ and let us know if you have any suggestions 🙇‍♂️.
Oh, and by the way, we are always recruiting talented and passionate people to join our team 🙌.
